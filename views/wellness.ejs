     <p>We believe in preventive wellness care. This is accomplished through routine semi-annual comprehensive exams, vaccinations, parasite prevention, urine and blood screening, good oral health and client education encompassing nutrition and behavior. Annual Wellness Plans offer an affordable way to provide high quality preventive healthcare to your pet. Wellness Plans are NOT insurance. They are designed to provide routine healthcare and diagnostics at a discount. With regular checkups, illnesses and diseases can be detected early, before they become worse and more expensive to treat. By bundling services and spreading the yearly cost over 12 months, you and your pet can concentrate on staying healthy.</p>
